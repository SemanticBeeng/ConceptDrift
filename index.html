    <h2>Predicting Concept Drift in Linked Data</h2>

    <p>The development and maintenance of Knowledge Organization
      Systems (KOS) such as classification schemas, taxonomies and
      ontologies is a knowledge intensive task that requires a lot of
      manual effort. Librarians, historians and social scientists,
      among others, need to constantly adapt these KOS to deal with
      the change of meaning of concepts (i.e. \emph{concept drift})
      that comes with new data releases and novel data links. In this
      paper we introduce a method to automatically detect which parts
      of a KOS are likely to experience concept drift. Our approach is
      based on using supervised learning on features extracted from
      past versions to predict the concepts that will experience drift
      in a future version. We find that a state of the art predictor
      for concept extension in biomedical ontologies can be adapted to
      predict concept drift in KOS in a domain-independent
      manner. This result is confirmed by our experiments on a variety
      of datasets (encyclopedic, cross-domain, and socio historical),
      enabling the creation of a generic tool to assist knowledge
      experts in their curation tasks.</p>
